# Polynomials Revenge
Expanding on the solution for `polynomials`, you can recover $i\times \gcd(f_2,f_3,f_4)$, where $i$ in this case is very small (60% of the time 1 digit). Thus since $\gcd(f_2,f_3,f_4) \equiv f_0\times f_1$, you can recover $f_0\times f_1$. Since coefficients of f_0 and f_1 always $< \sqrt p$ hence coefficients of $f_0*f_1$ < p, you can recover the coefficients by finding the p-adic expansion of $f_0(p)\times f_1(p)$. Thus after some math in terms of the coefficients of $f_0\times f_1$ we can recover $q$+$r$. Use simultaneous equation to recover $q$ and $r$, then decrypt.
