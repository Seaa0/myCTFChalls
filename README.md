# myCTFChalls
This repository consists of challenges (mostly crypto) I set for Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.
> The difficulty is only consistent within a single CTF.
## SST CTF 2025
This CTF was catered to an extremely beginner audience, so I'm only listing the 3 challenges that are of substantial enough difficulty.
| Name | Category| Tags  | Difficulty |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [Broken RSA](<SST CTF 2025/Broken RSA>) | Crypto  | RSA | Insane |
| [EC(D?SA)](<SST CTF 2025/ECDSA>)| Crypto  | ECC, RSA, ECM Factorisation | Insane (hardest) |
| [slowpoke 2](<SST CTF 2025/slowpoke 2>)  | Crypto  | Discrete Calculus | Insane |
