# myCTFChalls
This repository consists of challenges (mostly crypto) I set for Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions.
> The difficulty is only consistent within a single CTF.
## SST CTF 2025
This CTF was catered to an extremely beginner audience, so I'm only listing the 3 challenges that are of substantial enough difficulty.

| [EC(D?SA)](<SST CTF 2025/ECDSA>)| Crypto  | ECC, RSA, ECM Factorisation | Insane (hardest) |
| [slowpoke 2](<SST CTF 2025/slowpoke 2>)  | Crypto  | Discrete Calculus | Insane |
